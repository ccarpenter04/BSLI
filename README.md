## BSLI
A library that attempts to identify the language that a given class file was compiled from. This is useful for determining which standard runtimes are required ahead of time to do complete static analysis.

Pull requests are welcome along with suggested language additions and any hints as to how to better detect any of the supported source languages.

Unit tests also need to be written to verify correct functionality. Anyone is welcome to write them.

### Supported languages
* Java
* Scala
* Groovy
* Kotlin
* Ceylon

### Coming soon?
* Frege
* Clojure
* JRuby
