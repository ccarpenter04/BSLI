## BSLI
A library that attempts to identify the source code language that class files were compiled from.
This is useful for determining which standard runtimes are required ahead of time to do more thorough static analysis.

Pull requests that add support for detecting new source code languages, fix detection methods, and improve detection methods are welcome.

### Supported languages
* Java
* Scala
* Groovy
* Kotlin
* Ceylon
